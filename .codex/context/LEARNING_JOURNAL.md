# LEARNING_JOURNAL

Purpose: keep a compact memory of recurring execution pitfalls and verified
fixes for this repository.

## Update Rules

- Add or update an entry when a failure pattern is reproducible or documented.
- Prefer updating an existing entry over creating duplicates.
- Keep entries in English and free of secrets.
- Apply the new guardrail in the same task where the learning is captured.

## Entries

### 2026-04-18 - Schema work must validate both migration and startup paths
- Context: database and runtime tasks while the repository still carries both
  Alembic baseline ownership and startup `create_tables()` bootstrap behavior.
- Symptom: a schema change can appear correct in one path while still drifting
  in the other, which creates false confidence and hidden startup regressions.
- Root cause: schema ownership is temporarily split between formal migrations
  and MVP bootstrap convenience behavior.
- Guardrail: until migration-first ownership fully replaces startup bootstrap,
  every schema-affecting task must validate both the migration path and the
  current runtime startup assumptions, then sync docs and project state.
- Preferred pattern:
  - update Alembic or schema files
  - run targeted schema or runtime tests
  - verify startup assumptions still hold
  - record the dual-path impact in docs or project state
- Avoid:
  - treating Alembic success alone as sufficient proof that the runtime startup
    path is still safe
- Evidence:
  - current blocker and decision trail recorded in
    `.codex/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - follow-up migration-first task tracked as `PRJ-016`
